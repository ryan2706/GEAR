[Intro]
C    F/A    C/G    F/A
  
[Verse 1]
             C                   F
What gift of grace is Jesus my redeemer,
            C               Am     Gsus  G
There is no more for heaven now to give
         C                          F
He is my joy, my righteousness, and freedom
             C        G                  Csus   C
My steadfast love, my deep and boundless peace
  
[Chorus 1]
          F                     C
To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus
       F       C               Gsus  G
For my life is wholly bound to his
       C              Dm         C/E          F
Oh how strange and divine, I can sing: all is mine!
       C/G             G         C
Yet not I, but through Christ in me
  
[Verse 2]
The night is dark, but I am not forsaken
For by my side, the Saviour He will stay
I labour on in weakness and rejoicing
For in my need, His power is displayed
 
[Chorus 2]
To this I hold, my Shepherd will defend me
Through the deepest valley He will lead
Oh the night has been won, and I shall overcome!
Yet not I, but through Christ in me
 
[Verse 3]
No fate I dread, I know I am forgiven
The future sure, the price it has been paid
For Jesus bled and suffered for my pardon
And He was raised to overthrow the grave

[Chorus 3]
To this I hold, my sin has been defeated
Jesus now and ever is my plea
Oh the chains are released, I can sing: I am free!
Yet not I, but through Christ in me
 
[Verse 4]
With every breath, I long to follow Jesus
For He has said that He will bring me home
And day by day I know He will renew me
Until I stand with joy before the throne
 
[Chorus 4]
To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus
All the glory evermore to Him
When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat:
Yet not I, but through Christ in me!
 
[Tag]
         C          Dm              C/E          F
When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat:
       C/G             G         Am  F
Yet not I, but through Christ in me!
       C/G             G         Am  F
Yet not I, but through Christ in me!
       C/G             G         C
Yet not I, but through Christ in me!
